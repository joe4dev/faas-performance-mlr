	Abstract = {Summary Cloud Functions, often called Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), pioneered by AWS Lambda, are an increasingly popular method of running distributed applications. As in other cloud offerings, cloud functions are heterogeneous due to variations in underlying hardware, runtime systems, as well as resource management and billing models. In this paper, we focus on performance evaluation of cloud functions, taking into account heterogeneity aspects. We developed a cloud function benchmarking framework, consisting of one suite based on Serverless Framework and one based on HyperFlow. We deployed the CPU-intensive benchmarks: Mersenne Twister and Linpack. We measured the data transfer times between cloud functions and storage, and we measured the lifetime of the runtime environment. We evaluated all the major cloud function providers: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions. We made our results available online and continuously updated. We report on the results of the performance evaluation, and we discuss the discovered insights into resource allocation policies.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This Chapter provides an overview of serverless compute. Serverless compute is a cloud computing execution model in which the AWS Cloud acts as the server and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. AWS bases the price on the amount of resources the application consumes rather than on prepurchased units of capacity. AWS Lambda is the AWS serverless compute platform that enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for nearly any type of application or backend service-with zero administration. Only upload your code, and AWS Lambda performs all the tasks you require to run and scale your code with high availability. You can configure code to trigger automatically from other AWS services, or call it directly from any web or mobile app. AWS Lambda is sometimes referred to as a function- as-a-service (FaaS). Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development whereby software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs).},

	Abstract = {Abstract This chapter covers how the Swift language is used in one of these cloud environments, namely event-driven, or server-less, environments. There are many other advantages to using microservices. Because the ideally designed microservice is small and focused in function, it is easier for developers to understand and troubleshoot. Inter-module communication can be more challenging, or at least require more careful consideration, in a microservices application. Monolithic applications can rely on fast in-process method invocations between modules, and they frequently evolve into rather ``chatty- implementations. The key thing about serverless computing that makes it attractive to developers is that they can concentrate solely on application business logic development and avoid spending any time whatsoever dealing with infrastructure or application environment provisioning or deployment. OpenWhisk is an open source project that provides a distributed compute service to execute application logic in response to events. It delivers an event-driven platform within which one can execute code in response to the occurrence of some event.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This chapter discusses how design principles will help to squeeze the most performance possible out of the cloud resources. A typical scale-out scenario would involve a single EC2 instance hosting an e-commerce web server that's struggling to keep up with rising customer demand. The account administrators could take a snapshot of the EBS volume attached to the existing instance and use it to generate an image for a private EC2 AMI. They could then launch multiple instances using the AMI they've created and use a load balancer to intelligently direct customer traffic among the parallel instances. Auto Scaling is an AWS tool that can be g configured to automatically launch or shut down instances to meet changing demand. As demand rises, consuming a predefined percentage of your instance's resources, EC2 will automatically launch one or more exact copies of your instance to share the burden.},

	Abstract = {Summary Data-driven applications are essential to handle the ever-increasing volume, velocity, and veracity of data generated by sources such as the Web and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Simultaneously, an event-driven computational paradigm is emerging as the core of modern systems designed for database queries, data analytics, and on-demand applications. Modern big data processing runtimes and asynchronous many task (AMT) systems from high performance computing (HPC) community have adopted dataflow event-driven model. The services are increasingly moving to an event-driven model in the form of Function as a Service (FaaS) to compose services. An event-driven runtime designed for data processing consists of well-understood components such as communication, scheduling, and fault tolerance. Different design choices adopted by these components determine the type of applications a system can support efficiently. We find that modern systems are limited to specific sets of applications because they have been designed with fixed choices that cannot be changed easily. In this paper, we present a loosely coupled component-based design of a big data toolkit where each component can have different implementations to support various applications. Such a polymorphic design would allow services and data analytics to be integrated seamlessly and expand from edge to cloud to HPC environments.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Renewable and storable fuel hydrogen can be produced through light-driven water splitting using photovoltaic-biased electrosynthetic (PV-EC) devices. The required voltage to drive the reaction is approximately 1.5â€…V, which can be provided using multi-junction silicon solar cells. To generate these voltages at the operation point, the solar cells are electrically optimized with respect to the standard test conditions. However, if such devices were to be used outdoors, a wide range of different illumination conditions has to be considered. Herein, we discuss the dependence of the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency on the spectral quality, the incident illumination intensity and the operation temperature. It is found that in the case of high irradiation intensities (e.â€‰g. 1 sun), high operation temperatures reduce the PV performance, but the overall PV-EC device performance remains almost unchanged due to improved kinetics in the EC part. In contrast, when the illumination intensity is reduced, the loss in PV performance cannot be compensated by improved EC performances due to higher temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This chapter discusses how to understand the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. AWS performs its cloud magic using hundreds of thousands of servers maintained within physical data centers located in a widely distributed set of geographic regions. As Amazon's global footprint grows, the number of regions grows with it. When you request an instance of an AWS service, the underlying hardware of that instance will be carved out of a server running in one-and only one-AWS Region. This is true whether you're talking about an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) virtual machine instance, its Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage volume, a bucket within Simple Storage Service (S3), or a new Lambda ``serverless'' function. In all those cases, although that anyone anywhere in the world can be given access to your resources, their underlying physical host can exist in no more than one region. An AWS Region (with the current exception of the Osaka-Local region) encompasses at least two distinct Availability Zones connected to each other with low-latency network links. Although, for security reasons, Amazon zealously guards the street addresses of its data centers, we do know that a single AZ is made up of at least one fully independent data center that's built on hardware and power resources used by no other AZ.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Polystyrene-based anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have been fabricated using in situ click chemistry between azide and alkyne moieties introduced as side groups on functionalized polymers. The membrane properties such as water uptake, swelling ratio and conductivity were affected by the number of cations and the degree of crosslinking. The membranes containing a larger amount of trimethylammonium cationic groups (i.e. higher ion exchange capacity) showed high hydroxide conductivity when immersed in KOH solution, exhibiting a peak in conductivity (156â€‰mS cmâˆ’1) in 3 mol L--1 KOH solution. A higher degree of crosslinking tended to decrease conductivity. These membranes demonstrated relatively good stability in 8 mol L--1 KOH at 60â€‰$\,^{\circ}$C and maintained 33\%--62\% of initial conductivity after 49â€‰days with most of the loss in conductivity occurring in early stages of the test. In an alkaline fuel cell, the areal specific resistance was constant indicating good stability of the membranes. The observed peak power density (157â€‰mW cmâˆ’2) was comparable to that of other AEM-based fuel cells reported. {\copyright} 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

The chemical equilibrium calculations indicated that chlorine significantly increased the volatilization of Cd in the form of CdCl2. In addition, SiO2-containing materials can function as sorbents for stabilizing Cd. The effect of PVC added to the sludge on the migration of Cd in the sludge was greater than that of NaCl. As the temperature increased, both organic and inorganic chlorides reduced the Cd distribution in the bottom ash. The chloride concentration, and the incineration time exhibited insignificant changes in Cd emission. With the addition of either NaCl or PVC into the sludge, the phases of Cd present in the bottom slag were primarily present in the form of silica-alumina oxides or multi-metal oxide, which could inhabit the Cd volatilization.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Autonomous flight of unmanned full-size rotor-craft has the potential to enable many new applications. However, the dynamics of these aircraft, prevailing wind conditions, the need to operate over a variety of speeds and stringent safety requirements make it difficult to generate safe plans for these systems. Prior work has shown results for only parts of the problem. Here we present the first comprehensive approach to planning safe trajectories for autonomous helicopters from takeoff to landing. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, we compose an approximate solution by cascading various modules that can efficiently solve different relaxations of the planning problem. Our framework invokes a long-term route optimizer, which feeds a receding-horizon planner which in turn feeds a high-fidelity safety executive. Secondly, to deal with the diverse planning scenarios that may arise, we hedge our bets with an ensemble of planners. We use a data-driven approach that maps a planning context to a diverse list of planning algorithms that maximize the likelihood of success. Our approach was extensively evaluated in simulation and in real-world flight tests on three different helicopter systems for duration of more than 109 autonomous hours and 590 pilot-in-the-loop hours. We provide an in-depth analysis and discuss the various tradeoffs of decoupling the problem, using approximations and leveraging statistical techniques. We summarize the insights with the hope that it generalizes to other platforms and applications.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This study examined the concentrations of umami compounds in pork loins cooked at 3 different temperatures and 3 different lengths of cooking times. The pork loins were cooked with the sous vide technique. The free amino acids (FAAs), glutamic acid and aspartic acid; the 5â€²-nucleotides, inosine-5â€²-monophosphate (IMP) and adenosine-5â€²-monophosphate (AMP); and corresponding nucleoside inosine of the cooked meat and its released juice were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Under the experimental conditions used, the cooking temperature played a more important role than the cooking time in the concentration of the analyzed compounds. The amino acid concentrations in the meat did not remain constant under these experimental conditions. The most notable effect observed was that of the cooking temperature and the higher amino acid concentrations in the released juice of meat cooked at 80 $\,^{\circ}$C compared with 60 and 70 $\,^{\circ}$C. This is most likely due to the heat induced hydrolysis of proteins and peptides releasing water soluble FAAs from the meat into the cooking juice. In this experiment, the cooking time and temperature had no influence on the IMP concentrations observed. However, the AMP concentrations increased with the increasing temperature and time. This suggests that the choice of time and temperature in sous vide cooking affects the nucleotide concentration of pork meat. The Sous vide technique proved to be a good technique to preserve the cooking juice and the results presented here show that cooking juice is rich in umami compounds, which can be used to provide a savory or brothy taste.},

	Abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND Magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposite has been proposed as a promising and sustainable sorbent for the extraction and separation of target analytes from food matrices. Sample preparation based on nanocomposite presents several advantages, such as desired efficiency, reasonable selectivity and high surface-area-to-volume ratio. RESULTS A new graphene oxide/Fe3O4@polythionine (GO/Fe3O4@PTh) nanocomposite sorbent was introduced for magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction and flame atomic absorption spectrometric detection of zinc(II) in water, flour, celery and egg. To fabricate the sorbent, an oxidative polymerization of thionine on the surface of magnetic GO was applied, while polythionine was simply employed as a surface modifier to improve extraction yield. The properties of the sorbent were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, vibrating sample magnetometry and Fourier transform--infrared spectroscopy. The calibration curve showed linearity in the range of 0.5--30â€‰ng mLâˆ’1. Limits of detection (S/Nâ€‰=â€‰3) and quantification (S/Nâ€‰=â€‰10) were 0.08 and 0.5â€‰ng mLâˆ’1, respectively. CONCLUSION The method was applied for trace-level determination of Zn(II) in water and food samples, and its validation was investigated by recovery experiments and analyzing certified reference material. {\copyright} 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

	Abstract = {Summary Low-power devices are usually highly constrained in terms of CPU computing power, memory, and GPGPU resources for real-time applications to run. In this paper, we describe RAPID, a complete framework suite for computation offloading to help low-powered devices overcome these limitations. RAPID supports CPU and GPGPU computation offloading on Linux and Android devices. Moreover, the framework implements lightweight secure data transmission of the offloading operations. We present the architecture of the framework, showing the integration of the CPU and GPGPU offloading modules. We show by extensive experiments that the overhead introduced by the security layer is negligible. We present the first benchmark results showing that Java/Android GPGPU code offloading is possible. Finally, we show the adoption of the GPGPU offloading into BioSurveillance, a commercial real-time face recognition application. The results show that, thanks to RAPID, BioSurveillance is being successfully adapted to run on low-power devices. The proposed framework is highly modular and exposes a rich application programming interface to developers, making it highly versatile while hiding the complexity of the underlying networking layer.},

	Abstract = {Summary This chapter provides a brief introduction to precise isotopic measurement of the radioactive, radiogenic, two- and multi-isotopic elements including extinct nuclides available by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). It describes a separation method of the target element, filament loading, and TIMS techniques for each element. The chapter also shows the magnesium purification methods applicable to TIMS and some TIMS methods. The column calibration for TIMS can be roughly done by colorimetry and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Rubidium, strontium, barium, and major elements can be detected by FAAS. Rare earth elements (REEs) in 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA) solution are detected by color change of arsenazo III. TIMS is a prerequisite for the preparation of the standard solution of uranium for multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), because mass discrimination correction is determined by the standard measurements performed before and after the sample measurement in MC-ICP-MS.},

There are significant number of zwitterionic side chains in the PFAEM\_H\_C3 polymer and very few in the PFAEM\_CH3\_C3 or the PFAEM\_CH3\_C6 polymer. They have similar halide conductivity, but the PFAEM\_CH3\_C6 showed highest OHâˆ’ conductivity, 122 mS cmâˆ’1 at 80â€‰$\,^{\circ}$C and 95\% RH. The larger spacer chain polymer, PFAEM\_CH3\_C6 has a higher water uptake value (Î»â€‰=â€‰9) compared to PFAEM\_CH3\_C3(Î»â€‰=â€‰7) at 60â€‰$\,^{\circ}$C and 95\% RH in the Clâˆ’ form.

The fundamental understanding of organics-based electrocatalysis in alkaline media at the solid--liquid interface involves complex mechanisms and performance descriptors (from the electrolyte and reaction intermediates), which undermine the roads towards advance and breakthroughs. Here, we review and diagnose recently designed strategies for the electrochemical conversion of organics into electricity and/or higher-value chemicals. To tune the mysterious workings of nanocatalysts in electrochemical devices, we examine the guiding principles by which the performance of a particular electrode material is governed, thus highlighting various tactics for the development of synthesis methods for nanomaterials with specific properties. We end by examining the production of chemicals by using electrochemical methods, from selective oxidation to reduction reactions. The intricate relationship between electrode and selectivity encourages both of the communities of electrocatalysis and organic synthesis to move forward together toward the renaissance of electrosynthesis methods.},

	Abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND Arsenic in drinking water poses serious potential health risks in more than 30 countries with total affected population of around 100 million people. The present study is devoted to the development of innovative sorbents based on zeolite materials for As(V) sorption by modifying raw materials with iron oxyhydroxide and manganese oxychloride. Natural clinoptilolite and synthetic zeolite A were modified in order to obtain improved sorption of As(V). Sorption properties of newly developed sorbents were studied. Zeolites containing natural clinoptilolite are chosen due to relatively low cost and their broad use in industrial production as well as characteristic large surface area. RESULTS Results obtained indicate that modification of zeolites with FeOOH and Mn8O10Cl3 significantly improves the As(V) sorption capacity of newly developed materials. As(V) sorption on FeOOH-modified aluminosilicates follows the Langmuir model, while on unmodified aluminosilicates it is described by the Freundlich model. As(V) sorption kinetics on both modified and unmodified materials most precisely can be described by Lagergren's pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Elevated As(V) concentration on the surface of Mn8O10Cl3 crystals and amorphous FeOOH indicates these compounds as responsible for sorption increase. CONCLUSION Developed sorbents show improved performance in comparison with their unmodified counterparts, with a dramatic increase in As(V) sorption capacity up to 99.3 times in the case of FeOOH-modified calcium zeolite A. These materials have great potential for As(V) removal in aqueous medium. {\copyright} 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

	Abstract = {Summary Many tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) trees are capable of foliar water uptake (FWU) during leaf-wetting events. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that maintenance of leaf turgor during periods of fog exposure and soil drought is related to species' FWU capacity. We conducted several experiments using apoplastic tracers, deuterium labeling and leaf immersion in water to evaluate differences in FWU among three common TMCF tree species. We also measured the effect of regular fog exposure on the leaf water potential of plants subjected to soil drought and used these data to model species' response to long-term drought. All species were able to absorb water through their leaf cuticles and/or trichomes, although the capacity to do so differed between species. During the drought experiment, the species with higher FWU capacity maintained leaf turgor for a longer period when exposed to fog, whereas the species with lower FWU exerted tighter stomatal regulation to maintain leaf turgor. Model results suggest that without fog, species with high FWU are more likely to lose turgor during seasonal droughts. We show that leaf-wetting events are essential for trees with high FWU, which tend to be more anisohydric, maintaining leaf turgor during seasonal droughts.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Spinacia oleracea L. extract was immobilized on an octadecyl-bonded silica surface to produce a new sorbent for the solid-phase extraction of trace amounts of metal ions from aqueous neutral samples. A measurement of the metal content has been performed by using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. The affinity of the investigated bivalent metal cations for the modified sorbent are in the order: Pb(II) > Cu(II) > Ni(II) > Zn(II) â‰ˆ Cd(II) â‰ˆ Co(II). The quantum-chemically calculated chlorophyll-a--metal ion binding energies were consistent with the measured affinities of the corresponding metal ions to the investigated sorbent. The maximum sorption capacity obtained for Pb(II) was equal to 1.44 Î¼mol/g. The value of lead uptake was significantly higher in comparison to the one reported for other sorbents and biosorbents. Immobilized chlorophyll a is responsible for a chelation process with stoichiometry 1:1 owing to the porphyrin rings, which was confirmed by the quantitative analysis performed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The Toth adsorption isotherm model was applicable to the description of the adsorption process of either chlorophyll a or Pb(II). The structural analysis of sorbent was done using Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray detector.},

The architecture of DockerAnalyser is designed to crawl Docker images from a remote Docker registry, to analyse each image by running an analysis function, and to store the results into a local database. Users can build their own image analysers by instantiating DockerAnalyser with a custom analysis function and by configuring the architecture. More precisely, the steps needed to obtain new analysers are (1) replacing the analysis function used to analyse crawled Docker images, (2) setting the policy for crawling Docker images, and (3) setting the scalability options for obtaining a scalable architecture. In this paper, we also present 2 different use cases, ie, 2 different analysers of Docker images created by instantiating DockerAnalyser with 2 different analysis functions and configuration options. The 2 use cases show that DockerAnalyser decreases the effort required to obtain new analysers versus building them from scratch.},

	Abstract = {Building on theories of impression formation based on faces, this research investigates the impact of job candidates' facial age appearance on hiring as well as the underlying mechanism. In an experiment, participants decided whether to hire a fictitious candidate aged 50 years, 30 years or without age information. The candidate's age was signalled either via chronological information (varied by date of birth) or via facial age appearance (varied by a photograph on the r{\'e}sum{\'e}). Findings showed that candidates with older-appearing faces -- but not chronologically older candidates -- triggered impressions of low health and fitness, compared to younger-appearing candidates. These impressions reduced perceptions of person--job fit, which lowered hiring probabilities for older-appearing candidates. These findings provide the first evidence that trait impressions from faces are a determinant of age discrimination in personnel selection. They call for an extension of current models of age discrimination by integrating the effects of face-based trait impressions, particularly with respect to health and fitness.},

SAE Aerospace Standard AS755, which is widely used throughout the gas turbine industry for all types of turbine engines, provides a framework for the identification of engine locations that are significant in terms of propulsion system performance. The chapter also presents an overview of key engine design limits and the thrust ratings that are used in commercial flight operations. It addresses the topics of fuel flow and thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). The group of terms used to correct the fuel flow has its origin in propulsion theory dimensional analysis. The chapter describes the factors that influence the two key performance parameters of the engine---that is, the net thrust and the TSFC, respectively. It presents a series of simple algebraic functions that are sometimes used to model these parameters. The chapter closes with a description of installation losses and in-service engine deterioration.},

	Abstract = {A new selective and fast procedure based on magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction and zeta potential analysis is proposed for the determination of Cd (II) in some food samples. In the developed method, novel magnetic nanoparticles modified with thioglycolic acid were synthesized/characterized and also applied for quantitative determination of trace amounts of Cd (II) in food samples. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized via infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and adsorption--desorption experiments. These magnetic nanocomposites carrying Cd (II) could be easily separated from real samples simply by applying an external magnetic field; no filtration or centrifugation was necessary. Several parameters affecting the analytical performance, such as sample pH, amounts of nanocomposite sample, desorption solution volumes and coexisting ions, were investigated in detail. The detection limit of the method was 0.1 Î¼g lâˆ’1 while the relative standard deviation was 1.2\% for a Cd (II) concentration of 0.5 mg lâˆ’1. The proposed method was successfully applied to food sample analysis and standard reference material samples with satisfactory results, and excellent recoveries were obtained in the range 95--99\% even when the matrix, such as sea water, was complex.},

	Abstract = {Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) is a powerful tool for the determination of many elements in a variety of different sample matrices. With this method, liquid samples are injected into a radiofrequency (RF)-induced argon plasma using one of a variety of nebulizers or sample introduction techniques. The sample mist reaching the plasma is quickly dried, vaporized, and energized through collisional excitation at high temperature. The atomic emission emanating from the plasma is viewed in either a radial or axial configuration, collected with a lens or mirror, and imaged onto the entrance slit of a wavelength selection device. Single-element measurements can be performed cost-effectively with a simple monochromator--photomultiplier tube (PMT) combination, and simultaneous multielement determinations are performed for up to 70 elements with the combination of a polychromator and an array detector. The analytical performance of such systems is competitive with most other inorganic analysis techniques, especially with regard to sample throughput and sensitivity.},

It discusses the diagnostic tools that may be adopted to make quantitative assessments for model selection purposes. It focuses on individual risk process model selections under a loss distribution approach (LDA) structure, for the severity model and the frequency models. This can be achieved under a number of different frameworks such as information criteria, frequentist hypothesis testing, and Bayesian model selection approaches. The chapter involves the suitable modifications to classical hypothesis tests that should be considered when performing model selection on heavy-tailed models, for instance, for the severity distribution. It also involves the model selection of dependence features between multiple risks, such as model selection for the copula distribution, which may be used to link multiple risk processes. The chapter discusses popular approaches that have been proposed to perform copula dependence goodness-of-fit (GOF) testing and model selection.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is very much in the focus of interest today. Intensive research is carried out in leading laboratories trying to work out methods for making useful materials from this unwanted greenhouse gas using solar or wind power generated excess electric energy. In this work, electrochemical reduction experiments are carried out in homemade cells supplied with different metal electrodes. Electrolytes containing carbon dioxide absorbing components like monoethanolamine (MEA) or KHCO3, KOH, and K2CO3 solutions are used. Metal-containing species were noticed in the used electrolytes after being in contact with the metal working electrodes. Therefore parallel to the electrochemical measurements, the metal components in the electrolyte were checked with atomic absorption methods for getting better insight into the nature of the electrode passivation. This paper attempts to compare the behavior of different electrode materials (copper, nickel) in CO2 capturing media, and investigate of the products of the electrolysis using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and gas chromatography.},

	Abstract = {For the first time, a new mode of dispersive solid-phase extraction is presented as a simple, rapid, adsorbent-free and environmentally friendly method for the simultaneous microextraction and preconcentration of trace amounts of two metal ions (Pb2+ and Cr3+) and two anionic azo dyes (reactive yellow 15 (RY15) and reactive black 5 (RB5)). This method is based upon the in situ formation of a layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosorbent through an electrostatic induction process. In this method, extraction of the analytes is performed simultaneously with the formation of the nanosorbent only by adding hydroxide ions. After extraction and separation of the sorbent from the sample solution through a syringe nanofilter, the analytes are eluted by dissolving the LDHs in an acidic solution. Finally, the extracted metal cations and anionic azo dyes are directly determined by micro-sampling flame atomic absorption spectrometry and micro-volume UV--visible spectrophotometry, respectively. Under the optimal experimental conditions including 20 Î¼mol of hydroxide ions, 248.4:20.8 Î¼g lâˆ’1 of M2+:M3+ ions, 12 cycles of air agitation and 200 Î¼l of CF3COOH (2 M), good linearities were obtained for Pb2+, Cr3+, RY15 and RB5 in the concentration ranges 50--600, 5.0--280, 30--2500 and 30--2000 ng mlâˆ’1, respectively, with correlation of determinations higher than 0.995. The preconcentration factor for the target analytes was 50 in a 10 ml sample solution. The limits of detection were found to be 15, 1.5, 10 and 10 Î¼g lâˆ’1 for Pb2+, Cr3+, RY15 and RB5, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were in the ranges 4.3--6.1 and 5.5--6.8\%, respectively. Additionally, the presented method is applicable for the analysis of the target analytes in different water samples with reasonable recoveries (>87\%).},

	Abstract = {The building industry makes a great effort to reduce energy consumption. The use of nanotechnology is one of the approaches to surpassing the properties of conventional insulation materials. In this work, an industrial cost-effective method to manufacture highly porous materials with excellent thermal insulation properties is described. The materials are prepared from polystyrene recovered from the building sector and electrospun as nanofiber-based sheets. Varying electrospinning parameters allow controlling the morphology of the produced materials. The materials are obtained with differences in interfiber and inner-fiber porosity and morphology. The thermal conductivity of the freestanding and compressed materials is evaluated. Those differences affect the insulation performance: the materials with higher interfiber porosity show better thermal insulation in the freestanding state. An increase of the inner-fiber porosity leads to better insulation in the compressed samples. Insertion of carbon nanomaterials reduces the effects of the infrared Radiation. Nanofiber-based insulation materials from the recycled expanded polystyrene (EPS) show thermal conductivity values of 20 to 25 mW/mK (ie, 20\% to 30\% below the thermal conductivity of the commercial EPS). The effect of integrating polystyrene nanofiber sheets into conventional wall-building materials is also investigated in terms of thermal insulation. The nanofiber insulation sheets are sandwiched between two pieces of the building materials resulting in a drastic increase of the insulation effect. The materials have a great potential in using, for example, as thermal insulation for the restoration of historic buildings in the narrow central parts of the old towns.},

These areas are reduced by applying additional terrain averaging, which damps out the unphysical components of small-scale (~2Î”x) energy aloft induced by unfiltered topography in the initialization of the WRF model. First, a control simulation with the same design of the WRF-RAP model shows that the large-scale atmospheric conditions are well simulated but predict strong turbulence over the western mountainous region. Four experiments with different levels of additional terrain smoothing are applied in the initialization of the model integrations, which significantly reduce spurious mountain-wave-like features, leading to better turbulence forecasts more consistent with the observed data.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This chapter discusses the basic concept of cloud computing. Using a public cloud is about using other people's servers to run your digital workloads. In a sense, there's no significant difference between running a software application on servers hosted in your own office versus locating it within Amazon's infrastructure. In both cases, you need to make sure you've got sufficient compute, memory, network, and storage resources. In both cases, fast deployments and avoiding over-provisioning are key goals. But, particularly when it comes to the largest cloud providers, there are important differences. One of the defining characteristics of any public cloud computing platform is the way it automatically allocates resources to meet client requests. Practically, this means that you can, for instance, log in to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) browser console, and define and launch a virtual server (called an instance in the AWS world), and moments later your new instance will be ready for you. There's no need to wait for manual intervention by AWS employees. The flexibility of the self-serve system permits usage patterns that would have been impossible using traditional compute paradigms.},

The activities of these catalysts during the oxidation of glycerol in alkaline media were studied by electrochemical, analytical, and inâ€…situ spectroscopy techniques. Changing the noble metal (Pd or Pt) allowed the selectivity of the catalysts to be tailored during the electrooxidation of glycerol. This introduces the possibility of utilizing the catalysts in cogeneration processes for renewable energy sources and also of employing the catalysts to produce value-added molecules selectively. High-performance liquid chromatography evidenced that the PtRu material had excellent catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone, whereas the PdRu anode favored the production of glycerate.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Thanks to the content of valuable bioactive substances, yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is finding wider applications in aquaculture and marine fish husbandry. Highly bio-available and bio-assimilable yeast extracts, which are obtained through processes that remove cell walls, are of special interest. The current study examined the impact of yeast extracts added to commercial feed at concentrations of 2\% (group F2), 4\% (group F4) and 6\% (group F6) on growth, blood biochemistry parameters, liver and intestinal morphology, proximate body composition and the content of free amino acids in the muscle tissues of European pikeperch, Sander lucioperca (initial body weight = 10 g). At the termination of the experiment that ran for 60 days, the highest increases in body weight were noted in all the groups of fish that had received yeast extract (final body weight â‰ˆ 35 g vs. control group â‰ˆ 31 g). The daily and specific growth rates indexes were the highest in group F6. The alanine aminotransferase activity in this group was half of that in the control group (group C) (p < .05). The lowest levels of plasma bilirubin were noted in groups F4 and F6, while these groups had the highest hepatosomatic indexes that differed significantly to those of group C (p < .05). Microscopic analysis of the intestines indicated significant growth in the enterocyte height and supranuclear zone, or the so-called absorption space, as the quantity of yeast extract added to the diets increased. Yeast supplementation was not noted to have a significant impact on the proximate body composition or the contents of free amino acids in the fish muscle tissues. In conclusion, the lowest analysed dose of yeast (i.e. 2\% yeast extract) stimulates the growth of pikeperch.},

	Abstract = {Abstract For the last decades, molecular imprinting is developing intensively, especially in the case of the application of new imprinting techniques. In this work, for the first time, a Pickering emulsion polymerization was used to synthesize the S-naproxen--imprinted polymer spheres following a noncovalent protocol. To enhance the knowledge about imprinting process using mentioned technique, thorough analysis of the synthesis process was performed. Optimization of polymerization conditions included the selection of functional monomer, cross-linking agent, type of porogen, surfactant, and the choice of appropriate amount of the template and porogen. Prepared materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption. To study the binding properties, the sorption studies, including adsorption isotherms and competitive binding, were performed. Investigation of the effect of the functional monomer on the selective recognition of S-naproxen showed that the interactions between the template molecule and 4-vinylpyridine resulted in the best recognizing ability. Moreover, the synthesis with application of ethylene glycol dimethacrylae as a cross-linker, toluene as a porogen, and Tween 20 as an additional emulsion stabilizer gave the most desired result. The optimal ratio of the porogen to monomers mixture was 0.1, due to the fact that the increase of the porogen volume resulted in the significant increase of nonspecific uptake. In addition, the tenfold molar excess of functional monomer relative to the template turned out to be optimal. Subsequent binding studies demonstrated that the material synthesized using optimized polymerization conditions consists of imprinted sites that are sensitive for the S-naproxen.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We present a novel approach for measuring executive personality traits. Relying on recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we utilize the IBM Watson Personality Insights service to measure executive personalities based on CEOs' and CFOs' responses to questions raised by analysts during conference calls. We obtain the Big Five personality traits -- openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism -- based on which we estimate risk tolerance. To validate these traits, we first demonstrate that our risk-tolerance measure varies with existing inherent and behavioural-based measures (gender, age, sensitivity of executive compensation to stock return volatility, and executive unexercised-vested options) in predictable ways. Second, we show that variation in firm-year level personality trait measures, including risk tolerance, is largely explained by manager characteristics, as opposed to firm characteristics and firm performance. Finally, we find that executive inherent risk tolerance helps explain the positive relationship between client risk and audit fees documented in the prior literature. Specifically, the effect of CEO risk-tolerance -- as an innate personality trait -- on audit fees is incremental to the effect of increased risk appetite from equity risk-taking incentives (Vega). Measuring executive personality using machine-learning algorithms will thus allow researchers to pursue studies that were previously difficult to conduct.},

We show that less-lipophilic complexes 1 and 2 exhibit the highest toxicity [sub-micromolar inhibitory concentration (IC50) values] in A2780, HeLa, and MCF-7 cancer cells, and they are markedly more efficient than clinically used platinum drugs. It is noteworthy that the investigated Ir agents display the capability to overcome acquired and inherent resistance to conventional cisplatin (in A2780cisR and MCF-7 cells, respectively). We demonstrate that the Ir complexes, unlike clinically used platinum antitumor drugs, do not kill cells through DNA-damage response. Rather, they kill cells by inhibiting protein translation by targeting preferentially the endoplasmic reticulum. Our findings also reveal that the toxic effect of the Ir complexes can be significantly potentiated by irradiation with visible light (by more than two orders of magnitude). The photopotentiation of the investigated Ir complexes can be attributed to a marked increase (â‰ˆ10--30-fold) in intracellular reactive oxygen species. Collectively, these data highlight the functional diversity of antitumor metal-based drugs and the usefulness of a mechanism-based rationale for selecting candidate agents that are effective against chemoresistant tumors for further preclinical testing.},

	Abstract = {Abstract N-Fe-codoped TiO2/SiO2 nanocomposites were prepared and stabilized onto glass beads by coupling two methods of dip coating and heat attachment. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized by DRS-UV/Vis, FT-IR, XRD, FESEM, EDX, TEM, XPS, and N2 adsorption/desorption analyses. The operational parameters of pH, flow rate, and the photoreactor's angle against sunlight were optimized to achieve the highest degradation efficiency. Then, the photocatalytic efficacy of the prepared substrates was examined in a novel fabricated photoreactor on a complex pollutant mixture consisting of Cr (VI), BR-29, BB-41, and BY-51, under two irradiation sources of visible light and sunlight. Moreover, to virtualize the process under natural irradiation conditions, the effectiveness of the performance was evaluated in various outdoor climate circumstances. Consequently, the results demonstrated the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the prepared nanocomposites under visible and solar irradiations. The removal percentages were also considerable under a partly cloudy sky and were 91.73\%, 85.64\%, 87.23\%, and 58.59\% for Cr (VI), BR-29, BB-41, and BY-51, respectively. The results showed the promising activity of the innovative photoreactor and the as-prepared nanocomposites for photocatalytic remediation of the water pollutants under natural climate conditions.

These phenotypes were earlier found to be suppressed in Î”lon ssrA::cat/pUC4â€‰K and Î”lon faa (DnaJ, G232D) strains, called as ``Alp'' strains. We observed that a plasmid carrying an E. coli chromosomal fragment harboring few genes, a heat shock gene htpY and a portion of dnaK capable of encoding truncated N-terminal ATPase domain (244â€‰aa) could suppress lon mutant phenotypes. Deletion of htpY did not affect the efficiency of suppression. Clones expressing DnaKâ€² (244â€‰aa) peptide alone could suppress both Î”lon phenotypes in copy number dependent manner. Inactivation of clpQ did not affect the MMSR phenotype of Î”lon strain carrying dnaKâ€² clones indicating that ClpYQ protease does not degrade SulA. We hypothesize that the high levels of defective DnaKâ€²-DnaJ chaperone complex formed in these strains might lead to aggregation of SulA and RcsA and, thereby the suppression of Î”lon phenotypes. Systematic deletion analysis of dnaKâ€² revealed that, âˆ¼220â€‰aa N-terminal DnaK peptide is required for suppression of cps-lac over-expression and âˆ¼169â€‰aa peptide is enough for the suppression of MMSS phenotype of Î”lon mutant.},

	Abstract = {Textile and dye effluents have strong color, unstable pH and COD, a lot of inorganic salt, and high biotoxicity. It is difficult and inefficient to remove dyes from high-saline wastewater by traditional methods. In this study, a simple synthetic CuO/CeO2 photocatalyst is used to achieve high efficiency photodegradation of methylene blue in high salt wastewater. The p-type CuO/n-type CeO2 heterojunction photocatalyst is synthesized by a modified hydrothermal-calcination method. The XRD and XPS reveal the successful synthesis of CuO/CeO2 composite. The SEM and TEM images show that the sample consists of large amounts of well-dispersed CuO nanosphere loading on the CeO2 layers. DRS exhibits the absorption band (about 510 nm) and the band gap energy (2.43 eV) of the CuO/CeO2 composite. Compared with pure CuO, CeO2, and TiO2 (P25), the prepared CuO/CeO2 can increase the mineralization rate of MB by 18.19\%~33.74\%. More than 80\% of MB can be effectively removed in the wastewater containing 5~80 g/L NaCl with a wide pH value range of 2.11~9.02, and the degradation processes follow the pseudofirst-order reaction kinetics. Active species trapping experiments confirm that the degradation of methylene blue is mainly attributed to hydroxyl radical; besides, O2â–ªâˆ’ and hole (h+) also play important roles. Chlorine ions have dual effects in photocatalytic reactions. This work could provide a new approach to construct new heterojunction photocatalysts and a deeper insight for the treatment of hypersaline dye wastewater.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This chapter discusses how automation covers the workloads of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Automation is a best practice when it comes to designing architectures in the cloud. Automation allows common tasks to be repeated faster than doing them manually. These tasks can be simple and routine, such as installing the latest security patches on an EC2 instance running Linux. Or they can be complex, perhaps creating an entirely new and pristine AWS environment containing dozens of EC2 instances running a multitier, database-backed web application behind an application load balancer. The AWS Developer Tools are a collection of tools designed to help application developers develop, build, test, and deploy their applications onto EC2 and on-premises instances. These tools facilitate and automate the tasks that must take place to get a new application revision released into production. However, the AWS Developer Tools enable more than just application development. CodeBuild is a fully managed build service. A build is a set o d f actions performed on source code to get it ready for deployment. A build could include testing the code for errors or transforming it into a machine-readable language, but the specific build actions depend on the application.},

The catalyst was active in hydroformylation and could be used in successive reactions with negligible metal leaching.

	Abstract = {Abstract We present the design of a hydroformylation catalyst through the immobilization of air-stable Rh nanoparticles (NPs) on a magnetic support functionalized with a hyperbranched polymer that bears terminal phosphine groups. The catalyst modification with the hyperbranched polymer improved the metal--support interaction, the metal loading, and the catalytic activity. The catalyst was active for the hydroformylation of natural products, such as estragole, and could be used in successive reactions with negligible metal leaching. The phosphine grafting played a key role in the recyclability of Rh NPs under hydroformylation conditions. The catalytic activity was maintained in successive reactions, even if the catalyst was exposed to air during each recovery procedure. The modification of the support with hyperbranched polyester allowed us either to increase the number of Rh active species or to obtain more active Rh species on the catalyst surface.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The relationship between color change and other physical and chemical characteristics of sliced cooked cured beef (SCCB) during chilled storage were investigated using principal components analysis (PCA) to determine the color fading causes. Samples were prepared and stored at 8$\,^{\circ}$C for up to 35 days in a vacuum package to simulate a supermarket storage environment; related indicators were measured periodically every week. The results showed that the first PC explained 59.82\% of the total variation, and the second explained 22.28\%. PC1 was a concentrated reflection of color changes of SCCB during storage and PC2 was an environment factor causing the change of color. The change in apparent redness is mainly caused by redox reaction of the nitroso hemochromogen (NH) (eigenvectors of a*, C and NH in PC1 were all the maximum value of 0.28); a* was correlated with NH (0.96), free sulfhydryls (0.98), carbonyl derivatives (âˆ’0.95) formed during protein oxidation, and malondialdehyde (âˆ’0.98) and dienes (âˆ’0.92) formed by lipid oxidation. Color fading was significantly correlated with oxidizing and reducing power, existing forms of nitrogen and with the pH of the meat matrix.

	Abstract = {Abstract Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refer to the next generation of Information and Communication Technology systems that mainly integrate sensing, computing, and communication to monitor, control, and interact with a physical process to provide citizens and businesses with smart applications and services: health care, smart homes, smart cities, and so on. In recent years, health care has become one of the most important services due to the continuous increases in its costs. This has motivated extensive research on health care CPS, and some of that research has focused on describing the software architecture behind these systems. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate the research. This paper aims to identify and compare existing research on software architectures for health care CPS in order to determine successful solutions that could guide other architects and practitioners in their health care projects. We conducted a systematic literature review and compared the selected studies based on a characterization schema. The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of software architectures for health care CPS, describing their stakeholders, functional and non-functional features, quality attributes architectural views and styles, components, and implementation technologies. This systematic literature review also identifies research gaps, such as the lack of open common platforms, as well as directions for future research.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT In this work, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on chitosan (CS) and different fillers (room temperature ionic liquid [emim][OAc] (IL), metallic Sn powder, layered titanosilicate AM-4 and layered stannosilicate UZAR-S3) were prepared by solution casting. The room temperature electrical conductivity and electrochemical response in strong alkaline medium were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The ionic conductivity of pure CS membranes was enhanced, from 0.070 to 0.126 mS cmâˆ’1, for the pristine CS and Sn/CS membranes, respectively, as a function of the hydrophilic nature of the membrane and the coordination state of Sn. This hydrophilic and charge nature was corroborated by water uptake measurements, where only the introduction of IL in the CS membrane led to a water uptake of 3.96 wt \%, 20 or 30 times lower than the other membranes. Good thermal and chemical stability in alkaline media were observed by thermogravimetric analyses and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, respectively, and good interaction between CS and the fillers observed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and CV. Thus, thin CS-based MMMs (40--139 Âµm), resistant in high alkaline media, show higher conductivity than pure CS membranes, especially those fillers containing tin, and although the electrochemical performance is lower than commercially available anion-exchange membranes they have potential in pervaporation. {\copyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {Abstract Characterizing patterns of variation in plant traits across species and environmental gradients is critical for understanding performance of species in ecosystems. One-dimensional pattern of variation has been demonstrated in leaf traits, which is known as the leaf economic spectrum. However, it is unclear whether such a spectrum exists for root traits. For roots of 15 species from temperate grasslands, we determined respiration rate, relative growth rate, life span and 10 morphological, chemical and anatomical root traits. We further evaluated pairwise and multiple-trait relationships by Pearson's correlation and principle component analysis including phylogenetic contrasts. We found that root functions were related to three clusters of variation. Root respiration rate and relative growth rate were positively correlated with average root diameter (AD), but they were negatively correlated with specific root length (SRL). In contrast, root life span was not correlated with AD, but it was positively correlated with SRL. These results are inconsistent with the presumption of the root economic spectrum. The principle components analysis revealed a multi-dimensional pattern of variation in root traits among the 15 coexisting herbaceous species. Moreover, species within the same phylogenetic clades tended to have similar root trait syndromes. Most of the root traits exhibited a significant phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our results do not support a one-dimensional root economic spectrum in the coexisting herbaceous species of temperate grasslands. In contrast, the pattern of variation in root traits was multi-dimensional. We further demonstrated that species in different phylogenetic clades possess diverse root trait syndromes for efficient resource acquisition. Our findings provide a next step in understanding root functions and plant strategies in temperate grasslands.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Anticancer therapy by platinum complexes, based on nanocarrier-based delivery, may offer a new approach to improve the efficacy and tolerability of the platinum family of anticancer drugs. The original rules for the design of new anticancer platinum drugs were affected by the fact that, although cisplatin (cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2) was an anticancer drug, its isomer transplatin was not cytotoxic. For the first time, it is demonstrated that simple encapsulation of an inactive platinum compound in phospholipid bilayers transforms it into an efficient cytotoxic agent. Notably, the encapsulation of transplatin makes it possible to overcome the resistance mechanisms operating in cancer cells treated with cisplatin and prevents inactivation of transplatin in the extracellular environment. It is also shown that transplatin delivered to the cells in nanocapsules, in contrast to free (nonencapsulated) complex, forms cytotoxic cross-links on DNA.},

This chapter first describes main data fusion applications and architectures in UAS. Then, as most data fusion techniques combine problem uncertainties on the basis of Bayes rule, an overview of Bayesian algorithms for state estimation is presented.

The introduction of core-shell and porous architecture was realized by combining seed mediated and galvanic replacement reaction techniques. Next, we examined the catalytic efficiency of the nanocatalyst in comparison with solid palladium nanocube (Pd-NC) of similar size for the degradation of p-nitrophenol and organic dyes. The rate constant of Au-Pd NRTs was found nearly 12 times higher than the Pd-NCs. Further, we exploited our catalyst for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and observed its high intrinsic ORR activity. Compared with commercialized Pt/C, the Au-Pd NRT displayed nearly comparable onset and half-wave potential values and excellent durability upon potential cycling. The system level validation in a single-cell mode of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell also confirms the efficiency of the present catalyst to serve as a potential cathode catalyst for realistic device applications.},

The as-prepared TSC-Fe3O4/CTS was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that TSC-Fe3O4/CTS has high adsorption capacity and selectivity towards Cu(II) ions. Adsorption experiments were carried out with different parameters such as pH, solution temperature, contact time and initial concentration of Cu(II) ions. The adsorption process was better described by the pseudo-second-order model. The sorption equilibrium data was fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacity toward Cu(II) ions was 256.62 mg/g. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process of Cu(II) ions was exothermic spontaneous reaction. Moreover, this adsorbent showed excellent reusability and the adsorption property remained stable after five cycles.

However, site-directed mutagenesis studies supporting this hypothesis for others actinoporins are still lacking. Here, we demonstrate that disrupting the key hydrophobic interaction between V60 and F163 (FraC numbering scheme) in the oligomerization interface of FraC, equinatoxin II (EqtII), and sticholysin II (StII) impairs the pore formation activity of these proteins. Our results allow for the extension of the importance of FraC protein--protein interactions in the stabilization of the oligomeric intermediates of StII and EqtII pointing out that all of these proteins follow a similar pathway of membrane disruption. These findings support the hybrid pore proposal as the universal model of actinoporins pore formation. Moreover, we reinforce the relevance of dimer formation, which appears to be a functional intermediate in the assembly pathway of some different pore-forming proteins.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Cisplatin and other platinum-based drugs are well-known valid anticancer drugs. However, during chemotherapy, the presence of numerous side effects and the onset of frequent phenomena of resistance has pushed many research groups to devise new metal-based compounds holding improved anticancer properties and fewer undesired effects. Amongst the variety of synthesized compounds, significant antiproliferative effects have been obtained by employing organometallic compounds, particularly those based on silver and gold. With this in mind, we synthesized four compounds, two silver complexes and two gold complexes, with good inhibitory effects on the inâ€…vitro proliferation of breast and ovarian cancer-cell models. The antitumor activity of the most active compound, that is, AuL4, was found to be ninefold higher than that of cisplatin, and this compound induced dramatic morphological changes in HeLa cells. AuL4 induced PARP-1 cleavage, caspasesâ€…3/7 and 9 activation, mitochondria disruption, cytochromeâ€…c release in cancer-cell cytoplasm, and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, AuL4 treatment caused cancer-cell death by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, whereas no cytotoxic effects were recorded upon treating non-tumor cell lines. The reported outcomes may be an important contribution to the expanding knowledge of medicinal bio-organometallic chemistry and enlarge the available anticancer toolbox, offering improved features, such as higher activity and/or selectivity, and opening the way to new discoveries and applications.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Hydrochloric acid (HCl) leaching solutions were investigated with the aim of recovering the lithium present in industrial battery waste. The lithium-rich solution after HCl leaching of battery waste contains major impurities such as iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum, and copper. This composition was used as a model system to prepare a synthetic solution for lithium recovery by precipitation. The precipitation results indicated that the feeding rate of carbonate and stirring rate had an effect on particle size distribution. Uniform particles were obtained with a semi-batch process. A faster carbonate feeding rate can result in a smaller particle size due to the high supersaturation degree and chemical reaction rates.},

	Abstract = {Here, a simple but efficient way is demonstrated for the preparation of nanoporous graphene enriched with Fe/Co--nitrogen-doped active sites (Fe/Co-NpGr) as a potential electrocatalyst for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) applications. Once graphene is converted into porous graphene (pGr) by a controlled oxidative etching process, pGr can be converted into a potential electrocatalyst for ORR by utilizing the created edge sites of pGr for doping nitrogen and subsequently to utilize the doped nitrogens to build Fe/Co coordinated centers (Fe/Co-NpGr). The structural information elucidated using both XPS and TOF-SIMS study indicates the presence of coordination of the M--N (M = Fe and Co)-doped carbon active sites. Creation of this bimetallic coordination assisted by the nitrogen locked at the pore openings is found to be helping the system to substantially reduce the overpotential for ORR. A 30 mV difference in the overpotential (Î·) with respect to the standard Pt/C catalyst and high retention in half wave potential after 10 000 cycles in ORR can be attained. A single cell of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) by using Fe/Co-NpGr as the cathode delivers a maximum power density of â‰ˆ35 mWcmâˆ’2 compared to 60 mWcmâˆ’2 displayed by the Pt-based system.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Here, we present a proof-of-principle for a new high-throughput functional screening of metagenomic libraries for the selection of enzymes with different activities, predetermined by the substrate being used. By this approach, a total of 21 enzyme-coding genes were selected, including members of xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and amidohydrolase families. The screening system is based on a pro-chromogenic substrate, which is transformed by the target enzyme to indole-3-carboxylic acid. The later compound is converted to indoxyl by a newly identified indole-3-carboxylate monooxygenase (Icm). Due to the spontaneous oxidation of indoxyl to indigo, the target enzyme-producing colonies turn blue. Two types of pro-chromogenic substrates have been tested. Indole-3-carboxaldehydes and the amides of indole-3-carboxylic acid have been applied as substrates for screening of the ALDHs and amidohydrolases, respectively. Both plate assays described here are rapid, convenient, easy to perform, and adaptable for the screening of a large number of samples both in Escherichia coli and Rhodococcus sp. In addition, the fine-tuning of the pro-chromogenic substrate allows screening enzymes with the desired substrate specificity.},

@article{simpson:16,
	Abstract = {Summary Tropical grasses fuel the majority of fires on Earth. In fire-prone landscapes, enhanced flammability may be adaptive for grasses via the maintenance of an open canopy and an increase in spatiotemporal opportunities for recruitment and regeneration. In addition, by burning intensely but briefly, high flammability may protect resprouting buds from lethal temperatures. Despite these potential benefits of high flammability to fire-prone grasses, variation in flammability among grass species, and how trait differences underpin this variation, remains unknown. By burning leaves and plant parts, we experimentally determined how five plant traits (biomass quantity, biomass density, biomass moisture content, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion) combined to determine the three components of flammability (ignitability, sustainability and combustibility) at the leaf and plant scales in 25 grass species of fire-prone South African grasslands at a time of peak fire occurrence. The influence of evolutionary history on flammability was assessed based on a phylogeny built here for the study species. Grass species differed significantly in all components of flammability. Accounting for evolutionary history helped to explain patterns in leaf-scale combustibility and sustainability. The five measured plant traits predicted components of flammability, particularly leaf ignitability and plant combustibility in which 70\% and 58\% of variation, respectively, could be explained by a combination of the traits. Total above-ground biomass was a key driver of combustibility and sustainability with high biomass species burning more intensely and for longer, and producing the highest predicted fire spread rates. Moisture content was the main influence on ignitability, where species with higher moisture contents took longer to ignite and once alight burnt at a slower rate. Biomass density, leaf surface-area-to-volume ratio and leaf effective heat of combustion were weaker predictors of flammability components. Synthesis. We demonstrate that grass flammability is predicted from easily measurable plant functional traits and is influenced by evolutionary history with some components showing phylogenetic signal. Grasses are not homogenous fuels to fire. Rather, species differ in functional traits that in turn demonstrably influence flammability. This diversity is consistent with the idea that flammability may be an adaptive trait for grasses of fire-prone ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {To date, high mortality in women due to malignancy breast cancer related to the metastasis to the bone is a significant challenge. As, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) conjugated with the biocompatible polymers was employed for the delivery of some hydrophobic anticancer agents, the main aim of the current research was to assess whether cisplatin-loaded MNPs enhanced the anticancer effect of free cisplatin in breast cancer cells. MNPs decorated with PEG were synthesized by an improved coprecipitation technique, and then cisplatin was loaded onto the MNPs via a simple mixing method. Afterward, its morphology, size, chemical structure, magnetic property, hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, and crystal structure were characterized by scanning and transmittance electron microscopy, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray powder diffraction and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy respectively. Additionally, the effects of cisplatin and MNPs-PEG-cisplatin on viability, migration and adhesion capacity of T47D cells were investigated by evaluating Î±2-integrin and Î²1-integrin; mRNAs were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Consequently, the in vitro assay results showed a considerable dose-dependent inhibitory effect of cisplatin and MNPs-PEG-cisplatin on proliferation, migration, and adhesion of T47D cells. Finally, current research was shown that MNPs-PEG-cisplatin strongly increased anticancer effects compared with free cisplatin in the T47D cell line.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this research study, an efficient solid-phase extraction procedure based on a new organometallic, effective, eco-friendly and bio-degradable nanoadsorbent was firstly introduced for influential pre-concentration of Cu(II), Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) and Mn(II) ions from food and water samples followed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometric determination. This safe adsorbent consisted of silica nanoparticles chemically functionalized with di-ethylen tri-amine (SiO2@NH2NPs); easily prepared via an effective and simple approach. Characterization of SiO2@NH2NPs was subsequently implemented via SEM, FT-IR and XRD; certifying high quality of the modified nanoadsorbent in terms of size, shape and surface functional groups. The effects of the main factors on the extraction efficiency were then optimized. Efficient extraction of the analytes of interest at neutral media accompanied with the aid of a bio-compatible organometallic nanoadsorbent can be considered as valuable advantages of the proposed approach. In the optimum conditions, calibration graphs were linear in the range of 4--700â€…Î¼gâ€…lâˆ’1, with higher correlation coefficients than 0.997 and limits of detection of 1.45--4.10â€…ngâ€…mlâˆ’1. The enrichment factor values were found to be in the span of 120--400. The resultant extraction recovery values were satisfactory; possessing the proper relative standard deviation (\%, nâ€… = â€…5) values of 2.05--4.28\%.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Fluorescence opens up new opportunities to investigate diseases in the oral cavity. The application of fluorescence methods to detect caries, calculus, and cancerous tissue is discussed, and the working principle of devices using fluorescence to detect diseases in the oral cavity is explained. In order to assess the possible benefits of this technique, studies are reviewed that compare the performance to detect diseases of fluorescence devices such as quantitative laser fluorescence (QLF), DIAGNOdent, or VistaProof with conventional techniques such as X-ray or visual inspection. Related values of the sensitivity and specificity are given. It is found that using fluorescence devices the detection of diseases in the oral cavity can be improved. Therefore, the opportunity evolves to detect diseases in less-advanced stages and to improve the state of health of patients.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Recent advances in nanomaterials have identified nanogels as an excellent matrix for novel biomimetic catalysts using the molecular imprinting approach. Polymerisable Co-cyclen complexes with phosphonate and carbonate templates have been prepared, fully characterised and used to obtain nanogels that show high activity and turnover with low catalytic load, compared to the free complex, in the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, a nerve agent simulant. This work demonstrates that the chemical structure of the template has an impact on the coordination geometry and oxidation state of the metal centre in the polymerisable complex resulting in very significant changes in the catalytic properties of the polymeric matrix. Both pseudo-octahedral cobalt(III) and trigonal-bipyramidal cobalt(II) structures have been used for the synthesis of imprinted nanogels, and the catalytic data demonstrate that: i)â€…the imprinted nanogels can be used in 15â€‰\% load and show turnover; ii)â€…the structural differences in the polymeric matrices resulting from the imprinting approach with different templates are responsible for the molecular recognition capabilities and the catalytic activity. Nanogel P1, imprinted with the carbonate template, shows >50â€‰\% higher catalytic activity than P2 imprinted with the phosphonate.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Light signals are perceived by multiple photoreceptors that converge to suppress the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) for the regulation of stomatal development. Thus, COP1 is a point of integration between light signaling and stomatal patterning. However, how light signaling is collected into COP1 for the production and spacing of stomata is still unknown. Here, we report that the loss-of-function mutant of ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3) delays asymmetric cell division, which leads to decreased stomatal index. Furthermore, overexpression of AN3 accelerates asymmetric cell division, which results in clusters of stomata. In addition, the stomatal development through AN3 regulation is mediated by light signaling. Finally, we find that an3 is a light-signaling mutant, and that AN3 protein is light regulated. Self-activation by AN3 contributes to the control of AN3 expression. Thus, AN3 is a point of collection between light signaling and stomatal patterning. Target-gene analysis indicates that AN3 is associated with COP1 promoter for the regulation of light-controlling stomatal development. Together, these components for regulating stomatal development form an AN3--COP1--E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, allowing the integration of light signaling into the production and spacing of stomata.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Taking feed coal as a reference, the chemical states, content changes, microstructure, distribution, and graphitizable extent of carbon present in gasification fine ash were investigated in detail. The results show that the fine ash includes a significant amount of unreacted carbon. The C1s spectrum is composed of four components in which the contents of C--C and C--H decrease dramatically and graphitized carbon (39.1\%) presents. The elemental carbon primarily distributes on the layer structure, whereas elemental silicon and aluminum are mainly found on spherical particles embedded in the layer structure. After gasification, carbon atoms in gasification fine ash are arranged in an orderly manner, and the extent of graphitization of carbon increases, which indicates that carbon in feed coal may be partly graphitized and deposited in fine ash during gasification process.},

	Abstract = {Summary Air traffic complexity, which measures the disorder of air traffic distribution, has become the critical indicator to reflect air traffic controller workload in air traffic management (ATM) system. However, it is hard to assess the system accurately because there are too many correlated factors, which make the air traffic complexity nonlinear. This paper presents an air traffic complexity evaluation model with integrated classification using computational intelligence (ATCEM). To avoid redundant factors, critical factors contributing to complexity are analyzed and selected from numerous factors in the ATCEM. Subsequently, to construct the mapping relationship between selected factors and air traffic complexity, an integrated classifier is built in ATCEM. With efficient training and learning based on aviation domain knowledge, the integrated classifier can effectively and stably reflect the mapping relationship between selected factors and the category of air traffic complexity to ensure the precision of the evaluation. Empirical studies using real data of the southwest airspace of China show that the ATCEM outperforms a number of state-of-the-art models. Moreover, using the critical complexity factors selected in ATCEM, the air traffic complexity could be effectively estimated. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Ammonia (NH3), an important raw material for chemical industry and agriculture, is also considered to be an intriguing energy storage and transportation media for chemical conversion schemes. The world's primary NH3 supply is based on the natural nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs through an enzymatic nitrogenase process and the industrial nitrogen fixation through a traditional Haber--Bosch process. The natural synthesis of NH3 can hardly meet the rapidly growing global demand. Meanwhile, the industrial NH3 production is still dominated by the high-temperature and high-pressure reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen (N2 + 3H2 â†’ 2NH3), requiring intensive energy input and generating massive CO2. Therefore, seeking a breakthrough in the development of catalysts toward efficient ammonia synthesis has become the frontier of energy and chemical conversion schemes. This review summarizes and discusses the recent progress on developing new strategies to optimize the efficiency of NH3 production coupled with renewable energy sources, with a specific focus on electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3. The most recent advances in the development of catalytic materials, the design of the reaction systems, and the computational insights for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis are covered.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this research was to fabricate starch nanocomposites (NC)s using corn starch and MWCNTs-Valine as efficient fillers, and to examine the impact of nanofillers on the starch's properties. At first, Valine was grafted onto the MWCNTs' surfaces through a chemical reaction. Then, the functionalized MWCNTs (0.5, 1, and 2 wt.\%) were embedded in the starch by ultrasonic technique. The field emission scanning electron microscopy showed homogeneous distribution of nanofillers in the starch matrix. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the starch's thermal stability was improved after addition of MWCNTs. Finally, the adsorption behavior of the prepared NC for the elimination of copper ions from the aqueous solution was investigated.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The novel mesoporous silica-supported bis(diazo-azomethine) compounds have been synthesized and characterized successively. In the first step, 1,3-phenylenedimethanamine and 4,4â€²-diaminodiphenylmethane were diazotized, and the obtained bis(diazonium) cations were coupled with 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. The synthesized bis(diazo-carbonyl) compounds, 5,5â€²-((1,3-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(diazene-2,1-diyl))bis(2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde) (A1) and 5,5â€²-((methylenebis(4,1-phenylene))bis(diazene-2,1-diyl))bis(2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde) (A2) were chemically supported on amino-modified silica-gel (as L1 and L2). Elemental analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, liquid-phase NMR (1H and 13C) and solid-phase NMR (CP-MAS 29Si and 13C), FT-IR, TG/DTA, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques were used for characterizations of all the synthesized compounds. The syringe and batch techniques were applied for the solid-phase extraction properties of Pb(II), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Cr(III) ions using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy instrument. The recoveries of Pb(II), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Cr(III) ions have been achieved to 95--99\% with the (RSDs) of $\pm$â€…2--3\% in optimum conditions.},

	Abstract = {Summary Fruits and vegetables, because of their higher fibre content and beneficial phytochemicals, protect against various chronic diseases such as cardiac disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and several forms of cancer. These foods are not only the source of various dietary macronutrients and micronutrients but may also represent a source of exposure to several toxic elements. Indeed, environmental geochemistry, sources of irrigation and atmospheric deposition have a direct effect on the element composition of fruits and vegetables as they are the products of primary production. This chapter examines publicly accessible national databases (US FDA, West African, Tanzanian, Danish, Finnish, Japanese, Malaysian and Australian) to determine what elements are generally analysed in fruits and vegetables. These elements include macronutrients such as potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus as well as essential trace elements such as zinc, iron and copper. In addition to this, research articles have been reviewed to examine other datasets that included these and other elements. As many databases do not include toxic elements, this was the primary source of data for the toxic elements arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury. An assessment of the data tabulated indicates that for macronutrients there is no significant variation among more common fruits and vegetables. For trace nutrients, some fruits and vegetables, whether raw or in processed form, are significant sources of elements such as manganese and chromium. There are also indications that contaminated soils and irrigation lead to enrichment of elements in fruits and vegetables.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Analyses of mutations in genes coding for subunits of RNA polymerase always throw more light on the intricate events that regulate the expression of gene(s). Lon protease of Escherichia coli is implicated in the turnover of RcsA (positive regulator of genes involved in capsular polysaccharide synthesis) and SulA (cell division inhibitor induced upon DNA damage). Failure to degrade RcsA and SulA makes lon mutant cells to overproduce capsular polysaccharides and to become sensitive to DNA damaging agents. Earlier reports on suppressors for these characteristic lon phenotypes related the role of cochaperon DnaJ and tmRNA. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of two novel mutations in rpoB gene capable of modulating the expression of cps genes in Î”lon strains of E. coli in concert with HNS. clpA, clpB, clpY, and clpQ mutations do not affect this capsule expression suppressor (Ces) phenotype. These mutant RNA polymerases affect rcsA transcription, but per se are not defective either at rcsA or at cps promoters. The results combined with bioinformatics analyses indicate that the weaker interaction between the enzyme and DNA::RNA hybrid during transcription might play a vital role in the lower level expression of rcsA. These results might have relevance to pathogenesis in related bacteria.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We consider a modeling setup where the volatility index (VIX) dynamics are explicitly computable as a smooth transformation of a purely diffusive, multidimensional Markov process. The framework is general enough to embed many popular stochastic volatility models. We develop closed-form expansions and sharp error bounds for VIX futures, options, and implied volatilities. In particular, we derive exact asymptotic results for VIX-implied volatilities, and their sensitivities, in the joint limit of short time-to-maturity and small log-moneyness. The expansions obtained are explicit based on elementary functions and they neatly uncover how the VIX skew depends on the specific choice of the volatility and the vol-of-vol processes. Our results are based on perturbation techniques applied to the infinitesimal generator of the underlying process. This methodology has previously been adopted to derive approximations of equity (SPX) options. However, the generalizations needed to cover the case of VIX options are by no means straightforward as the dynamics of the underlying VIX futures are not explicitly known. To illustrate the accuracy of our technique, we provide numerical implementations for a selection of model specifications.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have become known as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial activity of AgNPs is dependent on the particle size and the dispersion status. In this study, a simple and effective approach is developed for sequestering the biosynthesized AgNPs in silica composites during the gel formation of MCM-41. Composites with different Ag concentrations of 0.034\% (Ag1@MCM-41), 0.151\% (Ag2@MCM-41), and 0.369\% (Ag3@MCM-41) are synthesized and then heated at 400 $\,^{\circ}$C to produce Ag1@MCM-41H, Ag2@MCM-41H, and Ag3@MCM-41H, respectively. The samples are characterized by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The AgNPs are confirmed to be highly dispersed in the amorphous silica framework. The antimicrobial activity of the AgNP--silica samples is investigated against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans using the cup--plate and the plate-count techniques. The results show an excellent antimicrobial effect of these samples against the studied microorganisms. Importantly, the AgNP--silica samples are found to be stable up to 58 months under ambient conditions. These stable and powerful antimicrobial composites provide a more practical and effective strategy for combating biomedical pathogens and public health threats.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of hierarchical porosity into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been of considerable interest in gas separation and heterogeneous catalysis due to the efficient mass transfer kinetics through meso/macropores. Here, a facile, scalable approach is reported for the preparation of carbon nitride (CN) foams as structural templates with micrometer-sized pores and high nitrogen content of 25.6 wt\% by the fast carbonization of low-cost melamine foam. The nitrogen functionalities of CN foam facilitate chemical anchoring and growth of ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate frameworks) crystals, which leads to the development of hierarchical porosity. The growth of ZIF-8 crystals also renders CN foam, which is hydrophilic in nature, highly hydrophobic exhibiting 135$\,^{\circ}$ of water contact angle due to the enhanced surface roughness, thus creating a natural shield for the MOF crystals against water. The introduction of ZIF-8 crystals onto the CN foam enables selective absorption of oils up to 58 wt\% from water/oil mixtures and also facilitates the highly efficient conversion of CO2 to chloropropene carbonate in a quantitative yield with excellent product selectivity. Importantly, this present approach could be extended to the vast number of MOF structures, including the ones suffering from water instability, for the preparation of highly functional materials for various applications.},

	Abstract = {Summary Body conformation at birth and teat number are economically important traits in the pig industry, as these traits are usually explored to evaluate the growth and reproductive potential of piglets. To detect genetic loci and candidate genes for these traits, we performed a GWAS on 269 pigs from a recently developed Chinese breed (Sushan) using 38 â€‰128 informative SNPs on the Affymetrix Porcine SNP 55K Array. In total, we detected one genome-wide significant (P = 1.31e-6) SNP for teat number on chromosome X and 15 chromosome-wide significant SNPs for teat number, body weight, body length, chest circumference and cannon circumference at birth on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18. The most significant SNP had an additive effect of 0.74 Ã— total teat number, explaining 20\% of phenotypic variance. Five significant SNPs resided in the previously reported quantitative trait loci for these traits and seven significant SNPs had a pleiotropic effect on multiple traits. Intriguingly, 12 of the genes nearest to the significant SNPs are functionally related to body conformation and teat number traits, including SPRED2, MKX, TMSB4X and ESR1. GO analysis revealed that candidate genes proximal to the significant SNPs were enriched in the G-protein coupled receptor and steroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway. Our findings shed light on the genetic basis of the measured traits and provide molecular markers especially for the genetic improvement of teat number in Sushan and related pigs.},

The morphology and structure of these s-IPNs are different from those obtained with solely h-CMC-g-PAN and Na-Alg indicating successive functionalization. The availability of the functional-rich bio-composites has afforded an excellent opportunity to test them as sorbents for the uptake of toxic Cd(II) ions from aqueous media. Subsequently, the uptake of Cd(II) ions was shown to be dependent on the pH, shaking time, temperature, amount of sorbent, and the initial concentration of the Cd(II) ions. The maximum Cd(II) ion uptake was 99.5\% at pH 6, using 50â€‰mg of sorbent with 120â€‰min shaking time at 25$\,^{\circ}$C. The adsorption isotherm fitted well with Langmuir model, with calculated maximum adsorption capacity 49.75 mgâ€‰gâˆ’1. The kinetic studies were modeled using a pseudo second-order reaction. The thermodynamic parameters (Î”Ho, Î”Go, and Î”So) of the uptake of Cd(II) ions onto s-IPNs were found to be âˆ’13,176.07â€‰Jmolâˆ’1, âˆ’4,572.7 Jmolâˆ’1, and 28.87â€‰Jâ€‰Kâˆ’1 molâˆ’1, respectively, verifying spontaneous exothermic process. Successive desorption and reusability of s-IPNs for the uptake of Cd(II) indicated, its high efficiency over three cycles.},

Schiff complexes of Ni(II), Pd(II), Pt(IV), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Mg(II) have been prepared by reaction of ion metals with as-prepared Schiff base. The results showed that synthesized complexes offered 1:2 metal-ligand ratios. Furthermore, the Schiff complexes were a tetrahedral in complexes Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), octahedral Pt(II), and square planer complex Pd(II). Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) was applied for calculations of both spectroscopic properties and electronic structure of prepared Schiff bases. Moreover, the Schiff base and its metal complexes have been verified in vitro against Streptococcus, Esherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis in order to assess their antibacterial potential. The findings indicate that the biological activity augments on complexation reaction.},

Once local incentive compatibility is satisfied, the problem of verifying global incentive compatibility is shown to be isomorphic to the problem of comparing two classes of distribution functions. Thus, tools from choice under uncertainty can be brought to bear on the problem. The approach allows classic justifications of the first-order approach (FOA) to be proven using the same unifying methodology. However, the approach is especially useful for analyzing higher-dimensional moral hazard problems. New and more tractable multi-signal justifications of the FOA are derived and implications for optimal monitoring are examined. The approach yields justifications of the FOA in certain settings where the action is multidimensional, as in the case when the agent is multitasking. Finally, a tractable multitasking model with richer predictions than the popular but simple linear-exponential-normal model is presented.},

We have focused our attention on the PDZ domain from hCASK (Human calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase) that binds extracellular CD98 in epithelial cells, being this antigen recognized as a marker for several human tumors and particularly considered a negative prognostic marker for human glioblastoma. We produced recombinant fusions of one or two hCASK-PDZ domains with the ribosome inactivating protein Saporin and assayed them on two human glioblastoma cell lines (GL15 and U87). These constructs proved to be toxic, with increasing activity as a function of the number of PDZ domains, and induce cell death by apoptotic mechanisms in a dose-dependent and/or time dependent manner.

	Abstract = {Abstract Over the last decade, influences of the human occupant on indoor chemistry have been investigated in environments ranging from simulated aircraft cabins to actual classrooms. We have learned that ozone reacts rapidly with constituents of skin surface lipids on exposed skin, hair, and clothing, substantially reducing indoor ozone concentrations but increasing airborne levels of mono- and bifunctional compounds that contain carbonyl, carboxyl, or Î±-hydroxy ketone groups. Moreover, occupants transfer skin oils to and shed skin flakes (desquamation) onto indoor surfaces. Evidence for the presence of skin flakes/oils has been found in airborne particles, settled dust, and wipes of indoor surfaces. These occupant residues are also anticipated to scavenge ozone and produce byproducts. Under typical conditions, occupancy is anticipated to decrease the net level of oxidants in indoor air. When occupants scavenge ozone, the level of SOA derived from ozone/terpene chemistry decreases; the fraction of SVOCs in the gas-phase increases, and the fraction associated with airborne particles decreases. Occupants also remove organic compounds, including certain chemically active species, via bodily intake. Studies reviewed in this paper demonstrate the pronounced influences of humans on chemistry within the spaces they inhabit and the consequences of these influences on their subsequent chemical exposures.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis is intimately dependent on free local Ca2+ near active zones. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have become an indispensable tool to monitor calcium dynamics during physiological responses, and they are widely used as a proxy to monitor activity in neuronal ensembles and at synaptic terminals. However, GECIs' ability to bind Ca2+ at physiologically relevant concentration makes them strong candidates to affect calcium homeostasis and alter synaptic transmission by exogenously increasing Ca2+ buffering. In the present study, we show that genetically expressed GCaMP6m modulates SV release probability at the mouse calyx of Held synapse. GCaMP6m expression for approximately three weeks decreased initial SV release for both low-frequency stimulation and high-frequency stimulation trains, and slowed presynaptic short-term depression. However, GCaMP6m does not affect quantal events during spontaneous activity at this synapse. This study emphasizes the careful use of GECIs as monitors of neuronal activity and inspects the role of these transgenic indicators which may alter calcium-dependent physiological responses.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the cytotoxicity of photosensitizers in the presence of light. Increased selectivity and effectivity of the treatment is expected if a specific uptake of the photosensitizers into the target cells, often tumor cells, can be achieved. An attractive transporter for that purpose is the folic acid receptor Î± (FRÎ±), which is overexpressed on the surface of many tumor cells and mediates an endocytotic uptake. Here, we describe the synthesis and photobiological characterization of polar Î²-carboline derivatives as photosensitizers covalently linked to folate-tagged albumin as the carrier system. The particles were taken up by KB (human carcinoma) cells within <90 min and then co-localized with a lysosomal marker. FRÎ± antibodies prevented the uptake and also the corresponding conjugate without folate was not taken up. Accordingly, a folate-albumin-Î²-carbolinium conjugate proved to be phototoxic, while the corresponding albumin--Î²-carbolinium conjugates without FA were nontoxic, both with and without irradiation. An excess of free folate as competitor for the FRÎ±-mediated uptake completely inhibited the photocytotoxicity. Interestingly, the albumin conjugates are devoid of photodynamic activity under cell-free conditions, as shown for DNA as a target. Thus, phototoxicity requires cellular uptake and lysosomal degradation of the conjugates. In conclusion, albumin--folate conjugates appear to be promising vehicles for a tumor cell targeted PDT.},

It discusses the case of the degenerate states and describes how to construct the many-particle wave function with definite permutation symmetry. The construction of wave functions describing states with the total spin and simultaneously satisfying the Pauli exclusion principle is discussed.

	Abstract = {The adsorption capacities of mesoporous silica modified with N-(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)ethylenediamine (MCM-41-NH2) and its 4-hydroxysalicylidene Schiff-base, MCM-41-N-Hdhba, as sorbents for removal and recovery of copper(II) ions from aqueous media have been investigated. The sorption uptake is highly dependent on the pH, contact time, temperature, diverse ions, mass of sorbent as well as initial Cu(II) ions concentration. At pH 6, the two sorbents, MCM-41-NH2 and MCM-41-N-Hdhba, show 96.4\% and 99.9\% Cu(II) ions removal, respectively. Langmuir isotherm gave the best fit of the experimental data with maximum adsorption capacities 138.8 and 222.2 mg gâˆ’1 for MCM-41-NH2 and MCM-41-N-Hdhba, respectively. The uptake kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order rate equation and the thermodynamic parameters (Î”H$\,^{\circ}$, Î”G$\,^{\circ}$ and Î”S$\,^{\circ}$) verified favorable, spontaneous, and exothermic for MCM-41-NH2 and endothermic for MCM-41-N-Hdhba adsorption processes. Successive adsorption--desorption studies indicated that MCM-41-NH2 and MCM-41-N-Hdhba maintain their adsorption and desorption efficiencies constant over five cycles. Of particular importance is the fact that MCM-41-NH2 and MCM-41-N-Hdhba were able to remove 95\% of Cu(II) ions from polluted river and tap water. The structures and physicochemical properties of the sorbents before and after adsorption of Cu(II) ions were characterized by using spectroscopic (FTIR and XRD), morphological (TEM-EDX), thermal, elemental analysis, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. {\copyright} 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 746--760, 2018},

	Abstract = {Abstract Acoustics is a very broad field of science that covers the generation, reduction, control, transmission, and reception aspects of sound. This chapter discusses three fundamental measures of sound. These are sound power, sound intensity, and sound pressure. In the field of acoustics, the decibel (dB), which is one-tenth of a bel, is almost exclusively used. The first weighting filter to be discussed is called A weighting and usually carries the associated symbol dBA or dB(A). The chapter summarizes the fundamental theoretical developments of acoustics in a fluid. When a wave propagating in a medium encounters a change in the impedance presented to the wave, reflection and transmission of the wave occur. The chapter outlines some general concepts associated with the use of passive noise control for reducing unwanted noise and explains concepts associated with active noise control. Finally, hearing loss, community and environmental noise, and sound quality analysis, are presented.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Hybridisation between crops and their wild relatives may promote the evolution of weeds. Seed germination and dormancy are the earliest life-history traits and are highly influenced by the maternal parent. However, the ecological role of the maternal effect on seed traits in the evolution of crop--wild hybrids has received little attention. In this study, we test the relative importance of maternal and hybridisation effects on seed traits of the first generation of crop--wild sunflower hybrids (Helianthus annuus). Seed germination was tested in two wild populations with contrasting dormancy, two cultivated materials and their reciprocal crosses at four different times after harvest and three different temperatures. Seed germination at each of the four times, after ripening response and secondary dormancy were recorded along with four morphological traits. Additionally, the pericarp anatomy was analysed with light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed strong maternal effects on all seed traits. Seed germination, morphology and pericarp anatomy differed largely between the crop and wild seeds and these traits in the crop--wild hybrids resembled their female parent. Slight but significant hybridisation effects were observed in germination, mainly in seeds produced on wild plants. Crop hybridisation changed seed germination, the after ripening response and secondary dormancy in the crop direction. Morphological and anatomical traits associated with domestication strongly correlated with the observed differences in seed germination and dormancy in crop--wild sunflower hybrids. The large maternal effects along with the evolutionary divergence in seed traits were responsible for the large phenotypic differences observed in crop--wild hybrids with the same genetic composition. Wild-like seed traits of hybrids suggest that there are no barriers to crop gene introgression at the seed level whereas crop-like seed traits could be strongly selected against, conditioning the selection of traits expressed later in the life cycle and in the next generations.},

Highly dense, well-ordered, undoped, and Co-doped ZnO NWs were successfully grown by hydrothermal method. Complementary CuO thin films were synthesized by sol--gel method and subsequently coated onto both undoped and Co-doped ZnO NWs through spin-coating technique. Enhanced diode properties with a rectification ratio of 103 at $\pm$2 V and an ideality factor of n = 2.4 (in dark) were obtained for Co-doped ZnO NWs-based heterojunction diodes.

	Abstract = {Summary Serious structural damage due to brittle fracture has motivated engineers and designers to develop passive controls of crack propagation in structures, known as crack arresters. The basic principle behind the use of a crack arrester is to reduce the crack-driving force below the resisting force that must be overcome to extend a crack. The crack arrester can be as simple as a thickened region of metal, or it may be constructed of a laminated or woven material that can withstand deformation without failure. This chapter provides different approaches to passive crack control in the form of crack arresters to stop crack propagation before it spreads over a structural component. Crack arresters used in ship structures, aircraft structures, and pipelines will be described for both metal and composite materials.},

Its corresponding complexes [(VO)2L(SO4)2], [Ni2LCl4], [Co2LCl4], [Cu2LCl4], [Zn2LCl4], [Cd2LCl4], [Hg2LCl4], [Pd2LCl4], and [PtLCl]Cl2 were analyzed by Fourier transform-infrared, (1H and 13C) nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass and UV--Vis spectroscopy. Experimental data showed that the ligand coordinated with the metal ions via donor atoms such as nitrogen to form an octahedral arrangement of the Schiff base around the central transition-metal atom. The nature of these complexes was identified using the molar ratio and Job's methods, with the results agreeing with a metal-to-ligand (M:L) molar ratio of 2:1, expect for Pt, whose M:L was 1:1. Thermodynamic activation parameters such as âˆ†E*, âˆ†H*, âˆ†S*, âˆ†G*, and K were determined from the thermogravimetric analysis curve using the Coats--Redfern method. The antioxidant activities of the prepared compounds were assessed by using 1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as the free radical, and the results show that the complex Schiff bases were found to possess potent antioxidant activity. The structure--activity relationship of the ligand and its complexes indicates that the presence of electron-donating moieties, such as Co(II) and Ni(II), in the chemical structure increases the antioxidant activity, whereas the Pt(IV) and Pd(II) complexes diminished the antioxidant activity, indicating the superior activity of the hydroxyl radical (OHÂ·) over the superoxide radical.},

	Abstract = {Summary Increasing rates of permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands are converting conifer forests to waterlogged open wetlands. Permafrost thaw increases soil nitrogen (N) availability, but it is unclear whether such changes are due solely to changes in surface soil N mineralization or N mobilization from thawing permafrost soils at depth. We examined plant species composition and N availability along triplicate permafrost thaw gradients in Alaskan peatlands. Each gradient comprised four community types including: (i) a permafrost peatland with intact permafrost, (ii) a drunken forest experiencing active thaw, (iii) a moat representing initial complete thaw and (iv) a collapse scar bog representing several decades of post-thaw succession. Concentrations of dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic N (DIN) in the upper 60 cm of soil increased along the permafrost thaw gradients. The drunken forest had the greatest mean concentrations of total dissolved N relative to the other community types, primarily due to greater concentrations of large molecular DON. The moat and collapse bog had significantly greater inorganic N concentrations than the permafrost or drunken forest, suggesting that changes in N availability are not a short-term effect, but can be sustained for decades or centuries. Across all plant community types, DIN and DON concentrations increased with soil depth during maximum seasonal ice thaw (September), suggesting that deeper soil horizons are important reservoirs of N post-thaw. Vegetation responses to permafrost thaw included changes in plant community composition shifting from upland forest species to hydrophilic vegetation with deeper rooting profiles in the collapse scar bogs and changes in foliar N and Î´15N values. N concentrations in plant foliage and litterfall increased with concentrations of DIN during collapse bog succession, suggesting that plants are utilizing additional mineralized N. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the conversion of forest to wetlands associated with permafrost thaw in boreal lowlands increases N availability, at least in part by increasing turnover of deep soil organic matter. Plants appear to utilize these additional deeper N sources over timescales of years to centuries following permafrost thaw.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The nutritional quality of grasses decreases with maturity due to increases in content of cell wall (CW) and lignified tissue, which affect the degradation and fermentation variables of the grasses. The effect of leaf age and tissue-microbial attachment during the degradation of Festulolium at 28 and 35 days of regrowth was evaluated in vitro by gas production. Fragments from the middle part of the blade of Festulolium leaves were stained for lignin with phloroglucinol solution, and the lignified area was measured. Subepidermal fibers of the abaxial and adaxial central vein of leaves contributed most to the lignification of Festulolium at 35 days compared with that at 28 days. Variables of gas production and concentrations of volatile fatty acids and ammonia nitrogen were affected by regrowth age. Activity for cellulases (8.19 IU/g dry matter [DM]) was highest between 12 and 16 hr of incubation and for xylanases between 16 and 24 hr (51.09 IU/g DM) without differences between regrowth ages. Scanning electron microscopy showed the following sequence: primary CW degradation started at 12 hr, a large population of microbiota were attached to CWs with extracellular protein complexes at 24 hr, and microbiota were attached to lignified cells at 48 hr. Therefore, during in vitro CW degradation of Festulolium, enzymatic activities increased before microbiota attachment to CWs, which was maintained when xylanase activity declined. Thus, structural analysis conducted using histochemistry and scanning electron microscopy helped to characterize the degradation of plant tissues and the interactions with ruminal microorganisms.},

	Abstract = {Summary The out-of-plane (OOP) behaviour of masonry infills (MIs), inserted in reinforced concrete (r.c.)--framed buildings, is recognized as one of the most important failure modes of this nonstructural element during an earthquake, which may be a consequence of simultaneous or prior in-plane (IP) damage. A five-element macro-model, with four diagonal OOP non-linear beams and one horizontal IP non-linear truss, with an equivalent mass of the infill panel divided between two central nodes, takes into account the IP and OOP failure modes occurring in the event of seismic loading. Pivot hysteretic models predict the non-linear IP and OOP force-displacement laws of the infill panel, based on geometrical rules defining loading and unloading branches. Firstly, a calibration of the proposed IP-OOP interaction model of MIs is carried out considering full-scale experimental results of traditional masonry typologies. Each specimen is initially subjected to in-plane quasi-static cyclic loading, until a maximum drift is reached, and then one-sided OOP cycles are imposed pushing in the horizontal direction and back to zero force. Then a numerical investigation considers masonry infills of an existing six-storey r.c.-framed building designed in compliance with a former Italian seismic code. To evaluate the interaction, the results of simultaneous IP and OOP cyclic tests on MIs at the top, intermediate, and lowest levels of the test structure are presented, assuming different displacement histories: (1) OOP loading faster than IP, at the sixth storey; (2) equal IP and OOP loading, at the third storey; (3) IP loading faster than OOP, at the first storey. Finally, attention is focused on the contribution of masonry infills to the IP and OOP energy dissipation of r.c.-framed structures.},

@article{schellstede:17,
	Abstract = {Pleba{\'n}ski's class of nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics is considered, which is for several reasons of interest at the present time. In particular, the question is answered under which circumstances Maxwell's original field equations are recovered approximately and which `post-Maxwellian' effects could arise. To this end, a weak field approximation method is developed, allowing to calculate `post-Maxwellian' corrections up to Nth order. In some respect, this is analogue of determining `post-Newtonian' corrections from relativistic mechanics by a low velocity approximation. As a result, we got a series of linear field equations that can be solved order by order. In this context, the solutions of the lower orders occur as source terms inside the higher order field equations and represent a `post-Maxwellian' self-interaction of the electromagnetic field, which increases order by order. It becomes apparent that one has to distinguish between problems with and without external source terms because without sources also high frequency solutions can be approximately described by Maxwell's original equations. The higher order approximations, which describe `post-Maxwellian' effects, can give rise to experimental tests of Pleba{\'n}ksi's class. Finally, two boundary value problems are discussed to have examples at hand.},

	Abstract = {Summary Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) are toxic compounds that are released in the environment as a consequence of industrial activities. The restoration of PAH-polluted sites considers the use of bacteria capable of degrading aromatic compounds to carbon dioxide and water. Here we characterize a new Xanthobacteraceae strain, Starkeya sp. strain N1B, previously isolated during enrichment under microaerophilic conditions, which is capable of using naphthalene crystals as the sole carbon source. The strain produced a structured biofilm when grown on naphthalene crystals, which had the shape of a half-sphere organized over the crystal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and GC-MS analysis indicated that the biofilm was essentially made of cellulose, composed of several micron-long nanofibrils of 60 nm diameter. A cellulosic biofilm was also formed when the cells grew with glucose as the carbon source. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed that the polymer was type I cellulose in both cases, although the crystallinity of the material greatly depended on the carbon source used for growth. Using genome mining and mutant analysis, we identified the genetic complements required for the transformation of naphthalene into cellulose, which seemed to have been successively acquired through horizontal gene transfer. The capacity to develop the biofilm around the crystal was found to be dispensable for growth when naphthalene was used as the carbon source, suggesting that the function of this structure is more intricate than initially thought. This is the first example of the use of toxic aromatic hydrocarbons as the carbon source for bacterial cellulose production. Application of this capacity would allow the remediation of a PAH into such a value-added polymer with multiple biotechnological usages.},

In the clinics, X-ray tomography is widely used for diagnostic purposes whose three-dimensional imaging in high resolution helps physicians to obtain detailed image of investigated regions. Researchers in biological sciences and engineering use X-ray tomography because it is a nondestructive method to assess the structure of their samples. In both medical and biological applications, visualization of soft tissues and structures requires special treatment, in which special contrast agents are used. In this detailed report, molecule-based and nanoparticle-based contrast agents used in biological applications to enhance the image quality were compiled and reported. Special contrast agent applications and protocols to enhance the contrast for the biological applications and works to develop nanoparticle contrast agents to enhance the contrast for targeted drug delivery and general imaging applications were also assessed and listed.},

	Abstract = {Summary Environmental effects can cause corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement in structural systems. These structural defects play a major role in structural life assessment. Corrosion is the degradation of metals due to chemical reactions with the environment, involving oxygen and/or water. On the other hand, hydrogen embrittlement is the process by which metals such as steel become brittle and fracture due to the introduction and subsequent diffusion of hydrogen into the metal. This chapter deals with the causes and effects of corrosion on steel and aluminum structures used in ships and aerospace systems. Since structural components made from aluminum and its alloys are vital to the ship and aerospace industries, the influence of environment on aluminum structures and the means of corrosion control and monitoring in both aluminum and non-aluminum metals will be presented. This chapter also considers the problem of fretting/wear in pipes of heat exchangers and nuclear plant. The problem of hydrogen-induced cracking is presented in terms of fatigue crack enhancement and modeling.},

	Abstract = {Summary Describing the flight behaviour of the helicopter presents an even more difficult challenge to mathematical modelling. The vehicle can be viewed as a complex arrangement of interacting subsystems. This chapter derives the expressions for the forces and moments acting on the various components of the helicopter; and considers the main rotor, tail rotor (TR), fuselage and empennage, power plant, and flight control system. It presents the combined forces and moments on these elements that are assembled with the inertial and gravitational forces to form the overall helicopter simulation equations of motion. The chapter takes the reader briefly beyond the realms of Level 1 modelling to the more detailed and higher fidelity blade element and aeroelastic rotor formulations and the complexities of interactional aerodynamic modelling. It focuses on the rotor dynamics, deriving expressions for the acceleration and velocity of a blade element and discussing different axes systems used in the literature for describing the blade motion.},
